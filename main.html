    <span class="line">Begin a day dedicated to New York icons with a bird's-eye view atop the <span class="bold">Empire State Building</span>.</span>
    <span class="line">Stroll up 5th Avenue past the leonine guardians of the <span class="bold">New York Public Library</span> and step inside to behold the gleaming Main Reading Room.</span>
    <span class="line">Forty-second Street takes you east to the beaux arts <span class="bold">Grand Central Terminal</span>, a hub of frenetic activity and architectural wonder. </span>
    <span class="line">Move on to the <span class="bold">Chrysler Building</span>, an art deco stunner, and continue east to the United Nations.</span>
    <span class="line">Make your way west across 49th Street to the triumvirate of Saks Fifth Avenue, <span class="bold">Rockefeller Center</span>, and St. Patrick's Cathedral.</span>
    <span class="line">Shopping, ice-skating at the Rockefeller rink, or visiting a nearby museum could fill your day until dusk, a good time to walk south on 7th Avenue toward the bright lights of <span class="bold">Times Square</span>.</span>
